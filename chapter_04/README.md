# Chapter 04 - Entities and Attributes

## Viewing the current diagram

Open file ch4-er-diagram.png. The file demonstrates the final state of entities as described in Chapter 4. You can use an image viewer (e.g., Windows Photos) to view the entities.

## Working with the ER diagram

### Using dbdiagram.io

#### Windows, Linux, and Mac

- Visit the [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) website.
- Click on the "Import Database" button on the left side of the page.
- Click on the "Upload a file" button.
- Select the file ch4-er-diagram.sql and click "Open".
- Click on the "Import" button.
- You can now view the current ER diagram. Changes can be made to the left. You can use "Export" to generate a new SQL file.

Note: dbdiagram.io is a free online service that allows you to create and edit ER diagrams. You can also generate SQL CREATE TABLE statements based on these diagrams. The current file contains all entities as described in their final state in Chapter 4. You can use this website to edit the entities as necessary. Use the reference manual for further help in editing the ER diagram online: [dbdiagram.io Reference Manual](https://dbdiagram.io/docs/).

### Using MySQL Workbench

#### Windows

- Visit the [MySQL Workbench Download Page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
- Download the mysql-workbench-community-8.0.33-winx64.msi file from "Other Downloads" section. The Download button is to the right. Make sure to download this file since if you download the MySQL Installer it will also install MySQL on your system (which we assume you already have installed from previous chapters and do not need to on this one).
- Follow the installation instructions from the installer.
- Once installed, double-click on the file or use File -> Open Model ... from within MySQL Workbench.
- The file (ch4-er-diagram.mwb) is a MySQL Workbench Document that allows you to edit entity relationship diagrams and generate SQL CREATE TABLE statements based on these diagrams. The current file contains all entities as described in their final state in Chapter 4.
- Once you see the entities you can freely double-click and evaluate them as well as make any necessary changes.

Note: MySQL Workbench is an administration tool for MySQL as much as an ER diagramming software. There are extensive tutorials for using the software but specifically for Database Design, you can use this part of the manual as a reference: [Database Design and Modeling](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-data-modeling.html)

Refer to [README.md](../chapter_01/README.md) from Chapter 01 for instructions about importing a sql file in your respective database system (e.g., MySQL).
